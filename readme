/* About Program */
This program is simple shell.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In phase1, user can use commands such as

cd, cd .. : to navigaite the directories in your shell
ls : listing the directory contents
mkdir, rmdir : create and remove directory using your shell
touch, cat, echo : creating, reading and printing the contents of a file
exit : shell quits and returns to original program(parent process)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In phase2, user can pipe commands such as

ls -al | grep filename
cat filename | less
cat filename | grep -v "abc" | sort -r
..etc

unfortunately, only two pipes are allowed this program. :(

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In phase3, user can use background commands such as

jobs : list the running and stopped background jobs
bg %(job_id) : change a stopped background job to a running background job.

[warning] fg %(job_id) : unfortunately, this command is not complete :(

kill %(job_id) : terminate a job.
ls -al | grep filename &
cat sample | grep -v a &
..etc
